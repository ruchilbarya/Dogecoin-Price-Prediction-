As social media is becoming an essential part of life, it has increasingly started influencing many complex systems which were not considered before. Recent events like
AMC, GameStop, show that social media has the power to enhance or reduce the value of financial assets. In this paper, the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and Twitter
is investigated.

The main components of this project are 

* Data Extraction (Tweets and Dogecoin Prices)
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis
* Model Creation
* Model Evaluation

# Objective
The primary goal of this study is to understand the effect of tweets on Dogecoin prices. This research focuses on the prediction of Dogecoin prices with the sentiment score via VADER sentiment analysis. This study uses an advanced deep learning technique called LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) to forecast the prices for a 15 days window.

# Results 
This study presents significant evidence that Dogecoin prices are affected by twitter sentiments. The results show that the model with a sentiment score provides the least mean square error. The mean square error is 0.05 is for a model with a sentiment score and 0.073 without a sentiment score. This shows that the twitter sentiments predict the Dogecoin prices with less error.
